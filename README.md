# ChainHabits

> Web3-powered habit tracker with social betting, streaks and tokenomics.

ChainHabits is a **habit tracking** and **social challenge** platform where users commit to routines, stake tokens, and get rewarded (or penalised) based on how well they stick to their habits.

- You join a **group challenge**.
- You define the **habits** you commit to (with difficulty levels).
- You **stake** an amount of tokens into a common pool (~ "betting" on your habits).
- Every day you log your progress using one of two proof types:
  - **Tier A — Verified**: payout-eligible proof coming from verified integrations and supported devices (e.g. Strava, GitHub, health APIs, sensors, etc.).
  - **Tier B — Self-report**: manual user input used for gamification, streaks and non-monetary progression only.
- At the end of the challenge:
  - payout-eligible scores are computed from verified completion data, difficulty and streaks,
  - a smart contract finalizes and distributes the pot based on the resulting payout plan,
  - you can claim your rewards on-chain.

Under the hood, the common pot is redistributed pro-rata of how well you stick to your routines, with a few performance tiers. If everyone completes more than a certain high threshold of their target points (for example >90%), then everyone simply gets back their full stake plus a shared bonus at the end of the challenge. Otherwise, users above a “strong performance” threshold (e.g. >85% of points) are guaranteed to get back their stake with a bonus, and that bonus pool is split between them pro-rata to their completion percentage. This bonus pool comes from the penalties of users who don’t reach the minimum bar (e.g. <80%): for each missing percentage point below that bar, they lose a small fraction of their initial stake (for example 0.5% of their stake per 1% of missing points) in their final payout. On top of that, users in the top tier (e.g. >95%) can earn extra non-monetary rewards from the app itself, such as rare trophies or “skip habit” tokens (see later). All thresholds and percentages are configurable and can be tuned per challenge.

This repository focuses on the **web frontend**, built with **Next.js** in a **mobile-first** approach, and designed to plug into:

- **smart contracts** (on-chain source of truth for stakes, challenge state and payouts),
- a **lightweight NestJS API** (off-chain orchestration, scoring, integrations, webhooks, caching and job scheduling),
- a **TEE-based verification layer** (e.g. a confidential verification app, potentially running through iExec, for Tier A verified integrations such as Strava or Github),
- a **NoSQL database** (MongoDB / Firestore for metadata, logs, verification jobs, integration references and score snapshots).

## 🧠 Project Concept

### Core ideas

- **Commitment device**: make it painful to quit your habits by putting money at stake.
- **Social challenges**: you play in groups (friends, communities, companies).
- **Tokenomics / Web3**:
  - stake tokens into a shared pool,
  - earn back more than you staked if you perform well,
  - optional reward token / NFTs for streaks and achievements.

### Proof tiers

ChainHabits uses a two-tier proof model:

- **Tier A — Verified**
  - API-attested or device-backed proof.
  - Examples: Strava, GitHub, health APIs, supported sensors/devices.
  - **Only Tier A data is eligible for monetary payouts and pot distribution.**

- **Tier B — Self-report**
  - Manual user declarations such as “I completed this habit”.
  - Used for gamification, streaks, XP, badges and soft progression.
  - **Tier B data does not contribute to monetary payouts.**

This distinction is a core security principle of the product:  
**money depends on verifiable signals, while self-reported data primarily supports engagement and habit-building.**

### At a high level

- **On-chain (smart contracts)**
  - Challenges (token used, minimum stake, dates, rules hash).
  - Stakes and challenge pot.
  - Final payout plan via a Merkle root.
  - Reward token and NFTs (optional).

- **Off-chain (backend + DB)**
  - Habit definitions and daily logs.
  - Verified integrations (Strava, Github, health APIs, supported devices).
  - TEE-based verification for payout-eligible Tier A data.
  - Scoring algorithm, payout plan generation and Merkle tree preparation.
  - Social feed, notifications, analytics.

- **Clients**
  - Mobile app (React Native / Expo – product priority).
  - This **web app (Next.js)**, mobile-first:
    - easier for dev iteration and admin / coach dashboards,
    - still usable as a regular user client.

## 💰 Business model ideas

ChainHabits is designed to enable multiple, combinable revenue streams while staying aligned with the core mission: **help people stick to their habits without turning the product into a casino**.

High-level mix:

- 🔹 **Micro-monetisation B2C**: skip tokens + power-ups  
- 🔹 **Premium subscription**: advanced stats, automation, extra features  
- 🔹 **On-chain platform fees**: small transparent rake on challenge pots  
- 🔹 **B2B / teams & coaches**: companies and creators paying for their own challenges  
- 🔹 **Utility token & NFTs**: Web3-native ecosystem without “investment” promises  

### 1. Micro-monetisation (B2C): skips & power-ups

**Weekly skip rule (baseline idea):**

- By default, each user gets **1 free skip per week**:
  - they can miss one habit/day but still keep their points and streak.
- If they want to **skip a second habit** in the same week *and still get full points*, they have to **pay**.

This is extended into a proper system:

- **Skip tokens**:
  - Every user gets 1 free skip token per week.
  - Additional skip tokens can be bought (fiat or protocol token).
  - Hard cap per challenge/period (e.g. max 2–3 paid skips per month) to avoid abuse.

- **Contextual skips**:
  - “Sick day” skip (less harsh, different price/limit).
  - “Travel day” skip (for trips / jetlag), possibly bundled with calendar data.

- **Power-ups** (limited, not pure pay-to-win):
  - **Freeze Streak**: pause your streak for a few days (no points, but streak preserved).
  - **Double XP Day**: one day where your habit points are doubled.
  - **Streak Revival**: recover a broken streak once per challenge.
  - **Focus Booster**: temporarily increase the weight of selected “hard” habits.

Design constraints:

- hard limits per user/challenge,
- some power-ups can only be **earned** (not bought),
- keep economic impact bounded so that performance still matters more than spending.

### 2. Premium subscription (CleanHabits+)

A recurring subscription for heavy users who want more depth and automation:

- **Premium features**:
  - Advanced analytics:
    - detailed breakdown by habit type,
    - streak heatmaps,
    - “weakest days / hours” analysis,
    - recommendations.
  - Enhanced automation:
    - unlimited integrations (Strava, Apple Health, Google Fit, Github…),
    - auto-check rules (e.g. “if Strava says ≥30min run → auto-complete this habit”).
  - Access to **premium challenges**:
    - curated, higher-quality groups,
    - larger pots or better reward structures.

- **Quality-of-life perks**:
  - more free skips per month,
  - more active challenges in parallel,
  - exclusive visual themes and profile customisation,
  - special badges or cosmetic NFTs.

The subscription can be paid in fiat or the protocol’s token, with potential discounts for token usage.

### 3. On-chain platform fees

For every on-chain challenge:

- A small **platform fee** is taken from the pot (e.g. 1–5%), fully transparent:
  - visible in the challenge creation UI,
  - encoded in the smart contract.
- Variants:
  - community challenges with **low fees**,
  - premium / co-branded challenges with **higher fees** and extra services (support, coaching, content).

This fee is automatically routed on-chain to the protocol treasury or revenue addresses.

### 4. B2B: companies, teams & coaches

ChainHabits can be packaged for organisations:

- **For companies / teams**:
  - “ChainHabits for Teams”:
    - HR/wellbeing/productivity challenges for employees,
    - company-sponsored pots and rewards,
    - dashboards for participation and anonymised stats.
  - Business model:
    - per-seat pricing,
    - or per-challenge packs,
    - plus optional add-ons (custom branding, integrations, support).

- **For coaches / creators / influencers**:
  - They can create their **own challenges** (fitness, coding, language learning, etc.):
    - set entry fees and stakes,
    - design rules and content.
  - Revenue:
    - a share goes to the coach,
    - a share goes to ChainHabits as a platform fee.
  - ChainHabits provides:
    - infra (smart contracts + scoring backend),
    - dashboards,
    - participants management.

Long term, ChainHabits can evolve into a **“challenge-as-a-service”** platform for behaviour change.

### 5. Utility token & NFTs

Without turning the token into a speculative asset, ChainHabits can support:

- **Utility token (e.g. HABIT)**:
  - Used to:
    - pay for skip tokens and certain power-ups,
    - reduce platform fees if paying in HABIT,
    - access token-gated premium challenges.
  - Part of the token used for utilities can be:
    - **burned** (deflationary pressure),
    - or **redistributed** to top performers / long-term stakers.

- **NFTs**:
  - **Trophy NFTs**:
    - 30-day streak,
    - perfect challenge (0 missed days),
    - early bird (X days completed before 7am), etc.
  - **Pass NFTs**:
    - access to exclusive challenges,
    - cosmetic perks,
    - or mild boosts, within strict limits.

Monetisation:

- mint fees for certain NFTs,
- optional royalties on secondary markets,
- NFTs as part of premium bundles.

All of this is built under a guiding principle:  
> **Help people build habits, don’t exploit addiction.**  
So limits, transparency, and a clear health/progression angle are integral to the business model.

## 💻 Frontend – Web App (Next.js)

This repo contains the **web frontend of ChainHabits**, built to be:

- **Mobile-first**: layouts and navigation optimised for small screens first.
- **Web3-oriented**: wallet-based identity, crypto/finance visual codes.
- **Gamified**: streaks, badges, progress bars, playful interactions.
- **Mock-friendly**: all data can be mocked for now, but structure is ready for real APIs and contracts.

### Tech stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with a reusable design system)  
- **State / Data**:
  - React Query (or similar) for server data (mocked APIs),
  - lightweight client store (Context / Zustand) for UI state.
- **Web3 (planned / progressive integration)**:
  - wagmi + RainbowKit or Web3Auth for wallet connection,
  - viem/ethers for contract calls.

> Today, most data can be mocked. The architecture is ready to plug into:
> - NestJS REST API for habits/logs/challenges,
> - EVM smart contracts for join/claim.

### Visual identity

- **Dark theme first**:
  - dark backgrounds,
  - bright accent colours inspired by crypto / DeFi (blue/purple/cyan, gradients).
- **Finance + gaming codes**:
  - cards, charts, progress indicators,
  - neon / glowing accents on important actions,
  - badges for difficulty levels and tiers.
- **Micro-interactions**:
  - transitions on hover/tap,
  - subtle animations when completing habits,
  - animated streak indicators.

---

## 📱 Main Screens & Flows (Frontend)

The frontend should expose **all main product surfaces**, even if data is mocked.

### 1. Auth & Wallet

- Landing / login screen:
  - “Connect Wallet” (Web3Auth or RainbowKit style).
- Once connected:
  - display wallet address (shortened),
  - show current network (mocked pill),
  - use wallet as the primary identity.

### 2. Home / Today

- Overview of **today’s habits** across active challenges.
- Quick actions:
  - check/uncheck today’s habits,
  - see which ones were auto-validated via APIs (Strava, etc.).
- Visuals:
  - progress bar for today,
  - streak indicators (“5 days in a row”).

### 3. Challenges

#### Challenges list

- Cards for each challenge:
  - name (e.g. “Habitants”),
  - status (Upcoming / Active / Finished),
  - period (start/end),
  - total pot (mock),
  - number of participants.

#### Challenge detail

- Full details of one challenge:
  - description, rules summary,
  - stake token & minimum stake,
  - scoring tiers (≥80% / 50–80% / <50%), difficulty weights,
  - your own status:
    - not joined → CTA to *configure commitments* and *join*,
    - joined → your stake, your current score, time remaining.
- Side components:
  - leaderboard preview,
  - participants count,
  - history / past performance.

### 4. Commitments & Join Flow

A multi-step UI (can be a wizard or stacked screens):

1. **Select / define habits** for this challenge:
   - list of available habit templates,
   - ability to add custom habits,
   - each with difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard) and frequency.
2. **Choose stake amount**:
   - show minStake + mock user balance,
   - input field with validation.
3. **Confirm & “sign”**:
   - simulate:
     - token approval,
     - join transaction.
   - show a stepper:
     - “Preparing transaction…”
     - “Joining challenge…”
     - “Joined successfully 🎉”

Right now, this flow can update **local / mocked state** instead of calling real contracts.

### 5. Daily Log (per Challenge)

- For a given challenge:
  - list user’s committed habits,
  - show difficulty and completion state for today,
  - allow manual “I’ve done this” toggles,
  - show icons for source:
    - manual,
    - Strava,
    - Github,
    - etc. (just mocked flags/labels).
- Additional:
  - aggregated stats for the current challenge,
  - remaining days, estimated tier / payout.

### 6. Social Feed

- Simple real-time-ish feed (mocked):
  - “0x1234… just completed day 15 in Habitants.”
  - “Your friend just overtook your streak in Deep Work challenge.”
- Allow simple reactions (likes/emojis – purely UI for now).

### 7. Profile & Stats

- Tied to wallet address:
  - display name, avatar, short address.
- Global stats:
  - total challenges joined,
  - overall streak record,
  - completion rate,
  - “XP” or score.
- NFT trophies area (mocked cards/icons).

### 8. Integrations / Settings

- Settings page:
  - “Connect Strava” / “Connect Github” / etc.
- For each integration:
  - show mock connection status,
  - clicking “Connect” simulates OAuth and toggles to “Connected”.
- This status should be reflected in the **Daily Log** view (auto-completed habits).
